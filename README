In this zip you will find my submission for the UCP assignment.

This includes a makefile, by default it has the debugging flag switched on, you can switch if off by removing the -g from 'DEBUGFLAGS' in the makefile.

To use the makefile simply type
	make

This should create you an executable called 'Calendar' which can be run using
	./Calendar
